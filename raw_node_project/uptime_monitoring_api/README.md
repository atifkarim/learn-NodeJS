# Uptime Monitor API

The goal of this project is to use only RAW Node JS to develop an application. Here, no third party libraries will be used. As storage platform, filesystem will be used(JSON). It will be a simple application for the beginner to know how to deal with Node JS.

# Execute the project

- To execute the project I have used nodemon package as it helps to fetch the change in runtime.
- I have added the script in package.json file.
- One can follow this [commit](https://github.com/atifkarim/learn-NodeJS/commit/b12e7eae01077ae9807a713b83f50986a10983ef) to start the project where the command will be `npm start` or `yarn start`
- But I prefer to use project name to execute, for this one can follow this [commit](https://github.com/atifkarim/learn-NodeJS/commit/b30a5431223bd0e77eb00292fe639ef7094a4b7c). Here the command will be
  `npm run uptime_monitor_api` or `yarn run uptime_monitor_api`
