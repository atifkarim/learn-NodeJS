# Node JS Learning

Here, I will try to practice Node JS

## Package manager

- npm
- yarn

### How to add npm pkg

- Suppose, `lodash` pkg will be installed using npm
  ```bash
  npm i lodash
  ```

### How to add yarn pkg

- Install yarn: `npm install -g yarn`
- Eg: Would like to add react package using yarn : `yarn add react`

## Environment Setup, Extension, Coding Guideline

- Follow [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) guideline
- Use the following [extensions](https://github.com/learnwithsumit/nodejs-basic-bangla?tab=readme-ov-file#extensions)
- Add the [json instruction](https://github.com/learnwithsumit/nodejs-basic-bangla?tab=readme-ov-file#settings) in project's `.vscode/settings.json` file
- Install [dev dependencies](https://github.com/learnwithsumit/nodejs-basic-bangla?tab=readme-ov-file#install-dev-dependencies). After this, in `package.json` file a key named `devDependencies` will come. The meaning of this is that, these packages are only for development purposes, during production if this `package.json` is used, these packages will be removed. And you can also see that the dependencies are installed using `-D` flag.

## Wiki

Concepts of Node JS is listed [here](wiki.md). However, this learning path is completed by following [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-g0JtEIwM&list=PLHiZ4m8vCp9PHnOIT7gd30PCBoYCpGoQM&ab_channel=LearnwithSumit-LWS-Bangladesh)
